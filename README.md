Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================

This repository was created for the course project of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data class.

Its main content refers to que R code used to process the raw data obtained [1] and the description of each variable.

To run the code, please install R (https://cran.r-project.org/).

The tidy dataset generated by the code consists of 180 means of 86 variables. Each row refers to 1 of the 30 volunteer sujects performeing 1 of the 6 activities recorded using a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II). The file generated by the code therefore is composed of 88 columns.

Notes on the process of colecting the raw data, please refer to the original source [1].


The repository contains three files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- 'run_analysis.R' : Shows the code used for getting and cleaning the original data.

- 'CodeBook.txt' : Shows the description of each variable.
